# Clone of Foot Locker Career Website
This project consists of two HTML files: index.html and jobs.html, along with a CSS file named style.css. The purpose of the project is to create a career website for Foot Locker, Inc., where users can learn about the company, explore brands and job opportunities.

## File Structure
 - The script starts with session_start() function, which initializes a session or resumes an existing one.
 - The script begins with session initialization and checks if the user is logged in. If not, it redirects to the login page. The HTML markup includes a navigation bar and displays the logged-in username.
 - A registration form with Bootstrap styling is included, along with JavaScript code. The PHP section handles form submission, inserting data into the "users" table.
 - There's also an HTML section for the login form, and PHP code authenticates the user by querying the database. Successful login redirects to "home.html." 
- index.html: The main page of the website, providing an overview of the company and its brands.
- jobs.html: A secondary page dedicated to job listings and job search functionality.
- The script also provides logout functionality, destroying the session and redirecting to the login page.
- style.css: The
 CSS file responsible for styling the HTML elements. It includes styles for various elements such as the navigation bar, headings, paragraphs, buttons, images, backgrounds, and more.
